Detecting a turn:
  - turns usually about 3 datapoints
    -- pre, during, post
    -- could iterate through 3 datapoints looking for stark changes in longitude/latitude
  - turns are much more than three datapoints
  - get an API to get windspeed, then use that in the thresholing
    -- wind direction with the API
    -- get angle of attack from user, put that into speed calculations
  - angle turn detection works the best, have to improve that
    -- dynamic thresholing dependant on windspeed and direciton 
    -- maybe remove even more data points? the turs are quite defined 
    -- dynamically remove points dependant on speed
  - collect speed from angle turns, take avg pf that and use as threshold
  - find two points where it seems a turn is occuring (get their gradient)
    -- graph an expected line and then compare deviation to that line (thresholded difference)


Questions for Stuart:
 - can I use AI packages, such as sklearn
 - can I use stack overflow
